# Resume Feed — Project Overview

> Shared document. An identical copy lives in `resumefeed-frontend/` and `resumefeed-backend/`.

## What we're building

A community site where people upload their resume into a public feed, and others
react, rate, and leave written reviews. The value is the community: constructive
criticism from real people in your field, instead of a paid resume review or a
black-box ATS score.

The product needs a professional landing page with a marketing pitch that sells
that community angle — people helping each other get hired through honest critique.

Key files:

- `src/app.ts` — middleware + route mounting point
- `src/routes/me.ts` — profile read/update; email is rejected, not ignored
- `src/middleware/auth.ts` — token verification
- `src/index.ts` — boots the DataSource, then listens; warns instead of crashing if the DB is unconfigured
- `src/config/data-source.ts` — entity/migration globs
- `src/config/supabase.ts` — service-role client
- `src/config/env.ts` — server env config
- `supabase/storage-setup.sql` — buckets and storage RLS, idempotent

## Seams between the two — known gaps

These are the specific places the two halves don't meet yet.

The `/api` prefix, the bearer token and server-readable sessions are all closed —
`GET`/`PATCH /api/me` exercises the whole chain end to end. What is left:

1. **Feed API shapes are not shared yet.** The database domain model is now in the
   backend, but feed responses still need a shared contract (or generated client)
   before the frontend consumes them. `MeResponse` is hand-mirrored in
   `src/routes/me.ts` and `store/api/profileApi.ts`; they drift silently.

2. **Profile changes are invisible to client components.** `PATCH /api/me` updates
   the auth user with the service-role key, so the browser's cached JWT still holds
   the old `user_metadata` until it refreshes. Server components are fine — they
   call `getUser()`, which hits the auth server — which is why the account form ends
   in `router.refresh()`. Anything reading metadata off the client session directly
   would show stale values.

3. **The community interaction loop is built end to end.** Rating, reaction, and
   comment endpoints exist and the feed consumes all of them. The comment shapes
   are hand-mirrored between `src/types/comment.ts` and the frontend
   `types/comment.ts`, so they drift silently — change them together.

## Settled decisions

- **Storage: Supabase Storage.** Decided 2026-09-11, replacing the earlier
  UploadThing note. Supabase is already the auth provider _and_ the Postgres host,
  so this is one less vendor and one less key, and RLS can gate a resume file by the
  same user ID that owns its row.

  **Buckets created 2026-09-11** by `resumefeed-backend/supabase/storage-setup.sql`
  — run that whole file in the Supabase SQL editor. It is idempotent.
  - `avatars` — **public**, 2 MiB, PNG/JPEG/WebP. Profile pictures render on every
    feed card, so a signed URL per render would be waste, and a picture is not PII
    the way a resume is.
  - `resumes` — **private**, 5 MiB, PDF only. Reads go through a signed URL minted
    by the Express API, which is where "may this person see this resume?" is decided.
  - Ownership in both buckets is the first path segment, `{user_id}/`, which the RLS
    policies compare against `auth.uid()`. Uploads must keep writing that shape —
    it is the only thing enforcing ownership.
  - Bucket names live in `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_{AVATAR,RESUME}_BUCKET` (frontend)
    and `SUPABASE_{AVATAR,RESUME}_BUCKET` (backend). They must match.

- **Profiles live in Supabase `user_metadata`, not a table.** `full_name` and
  `avatar_url` are enough for now, and keeping them on the auth user means the
  header and account page read them straight off the session with no join. Revisit
  when a profile needs anything a reviewer would search on.

- **Resume feed data model.** A `resumes` row is a public feed post and belongs to
  one Supabase Auth user through `owner_id`. It stores immutable PDF metadata and
  the relative `storage_path` in the existing private `resumes` bucket — never a
  permanent object URL. Every path must remain `{owner_id}/{filename}.pdf` to meet
  the storage RLS policy.
  - `resume_ratings` holds a 1–5 score and has one row per `(resume_id, author_id)`;
    changing a score updates that same row.
  - `resume_comments` holds written feedback (up to 2,000 characters). A row with
    a `parent_id` is a reply; threads are exactly two levels deep and a trigger
    re-parents anything deeper onto the root. Deleting a comment that has replies
    tombstones it (`deleted_at` set, body blanked) so the replies survive; a
    comment nobody answered is deleted outright. Tombstones are excluded from
    `comment_count`.
  - `resume_reactions` holds one of five kinds; a person may hold one per resume.
  - `comment_reactions` mirrors it for comments, sharing the same
    `reaction_kind_enum` and the same one-per-person rule. `resume_comments.reaction_count`
    is a trigger-maintained aggregate; per-kind tallies are grouped per page at read time.
  - `resumes.average_rating`, `rating_count`, `comment_count`, and `reaction_count`
    are feed-card aggregates. Database triggers maintain them on every child-row
    insert, update, and delete; an unrated resume has `average_rating = null`.

  Auth users are intentionally not duplicated or foreign-keyed in this schema;
  Supabase Auth remains the profile source of truth. API responses will hydrate an
  owner/commenter name and avatar from there.

## Open decisions

- **Schema changes now use migrations.** `DB_MIGRATIONS_RUN=true` applies pending
  TypeORM migrations at backend startup; `DB_SYNCHRONIZE` now defaults to `false`.
  Set synchronization to true only for a disposable local database.

- **Where does moderation live?** Partly settled: a resume owner can delete any
  comment on their own post, silently, which is the escape hatch against abuse on a
  document carrying their real name and phone number. See
  `docs/adr/0002-resume-owners-can-delete-comments.md` for the cost of that. Still
  open: whether uploads are public by default, whether commenters are anonymous,
  and how a resume itself gets taken down.

- **Notifications are a deliberate non-goal.** Nobody is told when their resume is
  commented on or their comment is answered. This is the thing that would make the
  loop actually loop, so it is the first candidate once the UI exists — but it is a
  whole subsystem (table, read state, polling or Realtime, a surface in the header)
  and nothing else in the product has one. It is missing on purpose, not by oversight.

## Suggested build order

- ~~**Auth end to end**~~ — done: pages, server actions, `proxy.ts` gating, bearer
  token, `requireAuth`, session-aware header.
- ~~**Profiles and storage**~~ — done: both buckets with RLS, avatar upload,
  `PATCH /api/me`.

1. ~~**Domain model**~~ — Resume, rating, comment, and reaction entities plus the
   first migration are complete.
2. **Landing page** — the marketing pitch; first thing anyone sees.
3. ~~**Upload**~~ — the frontend uploads a PDF into `resumes/{user_id}/`; the API
   verifies its ownership and MIME type before creating the resume record.
4. ~~**Feed**~~ — `GET /api/resumes` lists newest posts with ten-minute signed
   URLs; the viewer renders page one and opens the full PDF on demand.
5. ~~**Ratings, comments, and reactions**~~ — done. Rating and reaction on a resume,
   two-level comment threads with replies, editing, deletion and per-comment
   reactions, all wired into the feed card.

## Running it locally

```bash
# backend — terminal 1
cd resumefeed-backend
cp .env.example .env     # fill DATABASE_URL, SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
npm run dev              # :4000

# frontend — terminal 2
cd resumefeed-frontend
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # fill the NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_* vars
npm run dev                        # :3000
```

The backend logs a warning rather than crashing when `DATABASE_URL` is unset, so
the API will boot and serve `/health` before Postgres is wired up.

Once per Supabase project, paste `resumefeed-backend/supabase/storage-setup.sql`
into the dashboard's SQL editor and run it. Until that happens the account page
loads but an avatar upload fails with `Bucket not found`.
