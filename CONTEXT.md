# Resume Feed

A community site where people post their resume publicly and others rate, react to,
and critique it. The value is honest feedback from real people in your field, not a
paid review or a black-box ATS score.

> Shared document. An identical copy lives in `resumefeed-backend/`.
> Decisions that explain _why_ live in `resumefeed-backend/docs/adr/`.

## Language

### The post

**Resume**:
A community-visible feed post: one PDF document plus the metadata shown on its
card. The file itself stays private.
_Avoid_: Post, CV, upload

**Owner**:
The person whose resume it is. Exactly one per resume, and never called the author.
_Avoid_: Poster, uploader, author

**Feed**:
The reverse-chronological list of every resume on the site.
_Avoid_: Timeline, stream

### Feedback

**Comment**:
A piece of written feedback on a resume. The unit of critique.
_Avoid_: Review, critique, note

**Reply**:
A comment that answers another comment. A reply is a comment, not a separate kind
of thing.
_Avoid_: Child comment, sub-comment

**Thread**:
A comment together with its replies. A grouping, never a thing that gets created,
named, or stored — a thread exists the moment a comment has a reply, and stops
existing if the replies go away.
_Avoid_: Discussion, conversation, topic

**Author**:
The person who wrote a comment, rating, or reaction. Never the resume's owner.
When a payload carries both, they are `owner` and `author` and they are different
people unless someone is commenting on their own resume.
_Avoid_: Commenter, reviewer, reactor

**Rating**:
A 1-to-5 score on a resume. One per author per resume; scoring again changes the
existing one rather than adding another.
_Avoid_: Score, stars, vote

**Reaction**:
A one-tap response of a fixed kind, left on either a resume or a comment. One per
author per thing reacted to; picking a different kind replaces the previous one.
_Avoid_: Emoji, like

### Notifications

**Notification**:
An alert to a person that another person has newly commented on or reacted to their
resume, newly rated their resume, reacted to their comment, or replied to their
comment or reply. Changing an existing reaction or rating is not a new notification.
A notification is unread until its recipient opens it, unless they intentionally
mark it read.
Each reply notifies only the person directly answered, even when the reply is
displayed in another person's thread.
Each notification represents one activity event and is never grouped with others.
Notifications are in-app only.
Opening feedback-related notifications focuses the affected comment or reply in its
resume's thread; opening a resume-reaction notification opens that resume.
Notifications are shown newest first.
Notifications remain historical records when their source is deleted, but their
destination then states that the feedback is no longer available.
Notifications do not expire automatically.
When a reaction is removed, its notification remains but identifies the reaction as
removed. Re-adding that reaction creates a new notification.
_Avoid_: Alert, activity
